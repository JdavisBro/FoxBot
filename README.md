# FOXBOT
This is a work in progress modular bot mainly for deployment in the IBX Toy Chat discord but it can be used elsewhere if self hosted.
Currently I am working on the features stated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZ1twiLMZ0LWSdS2RCZjz0flF3J_ZwAREQ4k3cVwEV0/edit?usp=drivesdk) and once those are completed I will work on more features for fun LULW
If you see any shitty code make a pull request or let me know.
Maybe I'll host the bot myself for other people once it's done so that'd be cool.

Riddle of the day: what's 9+10
